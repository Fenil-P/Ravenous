# Ravenous
Client Side Search Restaurant App using React utilizing the Yelp API to search for businesses in a specific location. Users can sort by Best Match, Highest Rated and Most Reviewed. A link will take the user to the business' Yelp page when clicked on the name. Added functionality to press enter to search.

Note: Remember to add Yelp API key in Yelp.js. Also this is my First react app!

# In the project directory, you can run: `npm start`
